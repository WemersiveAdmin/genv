# NOTE(raz): This should be the layer that queries and controls the state of Genv regarding devices.
# Currently, it relies on executing the device manager executable of Genv, as this is where the logic is implemented.
# This however should be done oppositely.
# The entire logic that queries and controls devices.json should be implemented here, and the device manager executable
# should use methods from here.
# It should take the Genv lock for the atomicity of the transaction, and print output as needed.
# The current architecture has an inherent potential deadlock because each manager locks a different lock, and might
# call the other manager.
